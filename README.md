☕ **Java Utility Classes – java.util Exploration**

📘 **Overview**

This repository contains hands-on examples, mini-projects, and learning exercises that demonstrate the capabilities of the java.util package in the Java Standard Library. These utilities are the backbone of many Java applications—providing powerful, reusable tools for working with collections, dates, randomization, properties, and more.

🧰 **Covered Utilities**

📦 **Core Collections**
- List, Set, Map, Queue

- ArrayList, HashMap, HashSet, TreeMap, etc.

- Sorting with Collections.sort()

- Custom comparators using Comparator and Comparable
  

🕓 **Date and Time (Legacy)**
- Date usage

- Formatting with SimpleDateFormat
  

📅 **New Date/Time API (Java 8+)**
- LocalDate, LocalDateTime, ZonedDateTime

- Formatting with DateTimeFormatter

- Time zones and durations


🎲 **Random Utilities**
- Random for basic pseudo-random number generation

- ThreadLocalRandom for multi-threading contexts
  

⚙️ **Configuration & Properties**
- Reading and writing .properties files with Properties class

- Integrating configuration into Java applications
  

🔁 **Utility Helpers**
- Collections and Arrays helper methods

- Objects.equals(), Objects.requireNonNull()

- Optional for null-safe logic handling (Java 8+)
